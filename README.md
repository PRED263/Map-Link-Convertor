### The Story Behind the Tool

I was recently heading back to college from home when my new roommate sent me the location of our hostel. He has an iPhone, so he used Apple Maps. My Samsung, however, couldn't make sense of the link, as I rely on Google Maps. I ended up having to manually find the coordinates from his link, then copy and paste them into the Google Maps website.

It was a frustrating moment that started with me calling him a fool and ended with a realization: even in 2025, these small but annoying problems still exist. As big tech companies are in a digital "arms race" for technological superiority, simple cross-platform compatibility can get overlooked.

After I finally reached my room, I started working on this open-source tool to solve the exact problem I faced.

### üí° Future Roadmap

This tool was built to solve a specific problem, but there's always room for improvement! Here are some ideas for the future:

* Create a browser extension for one-click conversion.
* Add support for more map services (e.g., Waze, Here WeGo).
* Generate a QR code for the output link.
* Build it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an app-like feel.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
